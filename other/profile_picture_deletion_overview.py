BEFORE (Old Logic):
1. Get uploaded file
2. Generate storage key
3. Upload to Supabase
4. Update user.profile_picture
5. Save user
❌ Problem: Previous pictures accumulate in storage

AFTER (New Logic):
1. Get uploaded file
2. Check if user has existing profile_picture
3. If exists: Delete previous picture from Supabase storage
4. Generate storage key for new file
5. Upload new file to Supabase
6. Update user.profile_picture with new storage key
7. Save user
✅ Solution: Previous pictures are automatically deleted
