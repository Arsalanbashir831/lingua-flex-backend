# Enhanced Refund System API Documentation

## Overview
The LinguaFlex refund system provides automatic and manual refund processing based on session completion status:

- **Automatic Refunds**: Sessions that are PENDING, CONFIRMED, or CANCELLED get immediate refunds
- **Manual Review**: Sessions that are COMPLETED require admin approval

## üìä Refund Business Logic

### Automatic Refund Conditions:
- Booking status is `PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`, or `CANCELLED`
- Payment status is `COMPLETED`
- No existing refund request for the payment

### Manual Review Conditions:
- Booking status is `COMPLETED`
- Payment status is `COMPLETED`
- No existing refund request for the payment

### Refund Processing:
1. **Student Request**: Student submits refund with reason and amount
2. **Status Check**: System checks if booking is complete or not
3. **Automatic Path**: Immediate Stripe refund for incomplete sessions
4. **Manual Path**: Admin review required for completed sessions
5. **Stripe Integration**: Actual refund processed through Stripe API
6. **Status Updates**: Booking and payment statuses updated accordingly

## üîç Error Handling

### Common Error Codes:
- `400`: Invalid request data or business rule violation
- `404`: Payment or refund request not found
- `403`: Permission denied (wrong user or not admin)
- `500`: Stripe processing error or internal server error

### Error Response Format:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message describing the issue",
  "refund_request_id": 123  // If applicable
}
```

## üß™ Testing with Your Payment

Based on your successful payment response:
- **Payment ID**: 2
- **Amount**: $13.125
- **Booking ID**: 4
- **Status**: Payment succeeded

### Test Automatic Refund:
If the booking status is not `COMPLETED`, you can test automatic refund:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/payments/refund/request/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_STUDENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "payment_id": 2,
    "reason": "Student emergency - cannot attend",
    "requested_amount_dollars": 13.125
  }'
```

### Test Manual Review:
If the booking status is `COMPLETED`, it will go to manual review:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/payments/refund/request/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_STUDENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "payment_id": 2,
    "reason": "Teacher quality issues",
    "requested_amount_dollars": 10.00
  }'
```

## üìù Notes

1. **Stripe Integration**: Refunds are processed through Stripe and money returns to the original payment method
2. **Platform Fees**: Refund amount includes platform fees if requested
3. **Partial Refunds**: Students can request partial refunds (less than paid amount)
4. **Audit Trail**: All refund requests are logged with timestamps and reasons
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Available in Django admin for comprehensive refund management

The system ensures students get quick refunds for incomplete sessions while protecting against abuse through manual review for completed sessions.
