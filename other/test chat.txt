You cannot use Postman for WebSocket-based real-time chat in the same way you use it for REST APIs, but you can use Postman’s built-in WebSocket client (available in recent versions) to test your FastAPI WebSocket endpoint.

Here’s how to do it:

1. Start Your FastAPI Server
bash
uvicorn fastapi_chat:app --reload
2. Open Postman’s WebSocket Client
In Postman, click the New button and select WebSocket Request (or use the "+" tab and switch to "WS" at the left of the URL bar).
3. Connect to Your WebSocket Endpoint
Enter the WebSocket URL, e.g.:
ws://localhost:8000/ws/chat/1
(Replace 1 with your actual chat_id.)
Click Connect.
4. Send a Message
In the "Message" input box, enter a JSON payload, for example:
json
{
  "sender_id": 123,
  "content": "Hello, teacher!"
}
Replace 123 with the actual user ID of the sender.
Click Send.
5. Observe the Response
You should see your message echoed back (and if you open another WebSocket connection to the same chat, messages will be broadcast to all connected clients).
6. Receive Previous Messages
When you connect, the server will send all previous messages for that chat as individual JSON objects.
Tips
You can open multiple Postman WebSocket tabs to simulate multiple users in the same chat.
If you want to test authentication, you’ll need to add logic to your FastAPI server to check for tokens (let me know if you want to add this).
Summary:
Use Postman’s WebSocket client, connect to your FastAPI WebSocket endpoint, and send/receive JSON messages to test your chat functionality.

If you want a minimal HTML/JS test client, or want to add authentication, let me know!

2. Test the Chat API
You can use Postman, HTTPie, or any REST client to test. Here are example requests:

a. Start a Chat
Endpoint: POST /api/accounts/chats/start/
Body: { "user_id": <other_user_id> }
Headers: Auth token for the logged-in user
b. List User's Chats
Endpoint: GET /api/accounts/chats/
Headers: Auth token
c. Send a Message
Endpoint: POST /api/accounts/messages/
Body: { "chat": <chat_id>, "content": "Hello!" }
Headers: Auth token
d. Get Messages in a Chat
Endpoint: GET /api/accounts/messages/?chat_id=<chat_id>
Headers: Auth token
