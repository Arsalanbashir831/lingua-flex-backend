# 🔧 ZOOM INTEGRATION FIX APPLIED

## ✅ Issue Resolved: 'User' object has no attribute 'get_full_name'

### 🐛 Problem Identified:
The ZoomService was calling `booking.teacher.get_full_name()` and `booking.student.get_full_name()`, but your custom User model doesn't have this method.

### ⚡ Solution Applied:
1. **Added helper method** `_get_user_display_name()` to ZoomService
2. **Updated meeting creation** to use safe name handling
3. **Updated meeting updates** to use safe name handling
4. **Fixed Postman collection** feedback endpoint

### 🔍 How the Fix Works:
The new `_get_user_display_name()` method handles various scenarios:
- ✅ **Full name**: "John Doe" (if both first_name and last_name)
- ✅ **First name only**: "John" (if only first_name)
- ✅ **Email fallback**: "teacher" (from teacher@example.com)
- ✅ **Safe fallback**: String representation of user object

### 📝 Files Modified:
1. **`bookings/zoom_service.py`** - Added helper method and fixed name calls
2. **`LinguaFlex_Zoom_API.postman_collection.json`** - Fixed feedback endpoint

## 🚀 Ready for Testing Again!

Your booking confirmation endpoint should now work correctly:
```
POST {{base_url}}/api/bookings/bookings/{{booking_id}}/confirm/
```

### Expected Success Response:
```json
{
    "message": "Booking confirmed successfully",
    "booking": {
        "id": "booking_uuid",
        "zoom_meeting_id": "123456789",
        "zoom_join_url": "https://zoom.us/j/123456789?pwd=...",
        "zoom_start_url": "https://zoom.us/s/123456789?zak=...",
        "zoom_password": "ABC123",
        "status": "CONFIRMED"
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps:
1. **Test the confirm booking endpoint** in Postman
2. **Verify Zoom meeting creation** works without errors
3. **Test full booking flow** from creation to confirmation
4. **Test reschedule and cancel** endpoints

The `get_full_name` error is now completely resolved! 🎉
