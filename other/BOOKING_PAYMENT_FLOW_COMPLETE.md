## üí∞ Payment Calculation Logic

### Automatic Calculation
The system automatically calculates:

1. **Duration**: Calculated from `start_time` and `end_time`
   ```python
   duration_hours = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds() / 3600
   ```

2. **Session Cost**: Based on gig's hourly rate
   ```python
   session_cost = gig.price_per_session * duration_hours
   ```

3. **Platform Fee**: 5% minimum $1.00
   ```python
   platform_fee = max(session_cost * 0.05, 1.00)
   ```

4. **Total Amount**: Session cost + Platform fee
   ```python
   total_amount = session_cost + platform_fee
   ```

### Example Calculation
- **Gig Rate**: $50/hour
- **Session Duration**: 0.5 hours (30 minutes)
- **Session Cost**: $50 √ó 0.5 = $25.00
- **Platform Fee**: max($25.00 √ó 0.05, $1.00) = $1.25
- **Total Payment**: $25.00 + $1.25 = **$26.25**
