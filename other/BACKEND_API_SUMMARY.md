## Next Steps for Frontend Integration

1. **Authentication Setup**
   - Implement token-based authentication in your frontend
   - Store access tokens securely

2. **Voice Conversation Flow**
   ```javascript
   // After OpenAI speech-to-speech session
   const saveConversation = async (data) => {
       const response = await fetch('/accounts/voice-conversations/', {
           method: 'POST',
           headers: {
               'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
               'Content-Type': 'application/json'
           },
           body: JSON.stringify({
               topic: data.topic,
               transcription: data.fullTranscript,
               native_language: user.nativeLanguage,
               target_language: data.targetLanguage,
               conversation_type: data.sessionType,
               duration_minutes: data.duration,
               ai_feedback: data.aiAnalysis
           })
       });
       return response.json();
   };
   ```

3. **User Dashboard**
   - Display conversation history
   - Show progress statistics
   - Filter by language/type
   - Track learning progress

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Use summary endpoint for user analytics
   - Display improvement over time
   - Suggest next learning topics

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start Django Server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Run Test Suite**
   ```bash
   python test_voice_conversations.py
   ```
   (After updating the access token in the test file)

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Use Postman or similar API testing tool
   - Follow the examples in `VOICE_CONVERSATION_API_DOCS.md`

## Security & Performance Notes

- ✅ All endpoints require authentication
- ✅ Users can only access their own conversations
- ✅ JSON fields used for flexible AI feedback storage
- ✅ Proper validation on all required fields
- ✅ Efficient database queries with filtering

Your backend is now ready to support a comprehensive language learning platform with integrated OpenAI speech-to-speech functionality! 🚀
