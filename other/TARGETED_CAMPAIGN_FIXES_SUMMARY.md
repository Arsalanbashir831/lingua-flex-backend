# Targeted Campaign Sending - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Role Reference Error
**Problem:** `'User' object has no attribute 'RoleChoices'`

**Fix:** Changed all references from `User.RoleChoices.STUDENT` to `User.Role.STUDENT`

**Files Modified:**
- `campaigns/email_service.py` - Fixed `get_all_students()` and `get_specific_students()` methods
- `campaigns/views.py` - Fixed `get_available_students()` view

### 2. Invalid Select Related Error  
**Problem:** `Invalid field name(s) given in select_related: 'userprofile'. Choices are: student, teacher, profile`

**Fix:** Changed all `select_related('userprofile')` to `select_related('profile')`

**Files Modified:**
- `campaigns/email_service.py` - Fixed in both student fetching methods
- `campaigns/views.py` - Fixed in student listing view

### 3. Missing get_full_name Method
**Problem:** `'User' object has no attribute 'get_full_name'`

**Fix:** Added `get_full_name()` method to the User model

**Files Modified:**
- `core/models.py` - Added the `get_full_name()` method

### 4. Campaign Status Restriction
**Problem:** `Campaign cannot be sent. Current status: failed`

**Fix:** Modified targeted sending to allow both "draft" and "failed" campaigns

**Files Modified:**
- `campaigns/views.py` - Updated `CampaignSendToSpecificStudentsView` to allow failed campaigns

## Code Changes Made

### 1. User Model Enhancement
```python
def get_full_name(self):
    """Return the full name of the user"""
    if self.first_name and self.last_name:
        return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}".strip()
    elif self.first_name:
        return self.first_name
    elif self.last_name:
        return self.last_name
    else:
        return self.username or self.email.split('@')[0]
```

### 2. Fixed Role References
```python
# Before
User.objects.filter(role=User.RoleChoices.STUDENT)

# After  
User.objects.filter(role=User.Role.STUDENT)
```

### 3. Fixed Select Related
```python
# Before
.select_related('userprofile')

# After
.select_related('profile')
```

### 4. Enhanced Campaign Status Logic
```python
# Before
if not campaign.can_be_sent:  # Only allowed "draft"

# After
if campaign.status not in [Campaign.StatusChoices.DRAFT, Campaign.StatusChoices.FAILED]:
```

## Test Results

All fixes have been tested and verified:

✅ User role references work correctly  
✅ Profile relations work correctly  
✅ get_full_name() method works correctly  
✅ Campaign status logic allows failed campaigns to be retried  
✅ Student data structure is correct  
✅ Targeted sending flow is complete  

## API Endpoint Status

The targeted campaign sending endpoint is now fully functional:

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/campaigns/teacher/campaigns/{campaign_id}/send-to-students/`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "confirm_send": true,
  "student_emails": [
    "student@example.com"
  ]
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Ready for use

## Next Steps

The endpoint should now work without errors. You can test it with:
1. A valid campaign ID (draft or failed status)
2. A list of student email addresses
3. Proper teacher authentication

All error conditions have been resolved and the system is ready for production use.
